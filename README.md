# Game Enhancements

## Overview

This project is a physics-based slingshot game where the player aims and shoots a ball towards a target. To enhance the player's experience, I have made several improvements to the base game, including levels, audio, and visual enhancements.

## Enhancements

### 1. **Loyalty-Free Background Music**
   - I added loyalty-free background music to the game. This music plays in the background, providing a more immersive and pleasant experience for the player. The music loops continuously and is designed to complement the gameplay without being distracting.

### 2. **Ball Sounds**
   - I incorporated sound effects for the ball's interactions. Now, the ball makes a satisfying sound when it's launched, adding to the realism and enjoyment of the game.
